This strategy is a powerhouse for scalping and intraday trading because it blends institutional logic (liquidity/SMC) with mechanical precision (timing/candle rules). To implement this in your Replit HF Confluence app, we need to convert these four distinct methods into a programmatic "If/Then" logic.1. The ICC & Wick-Fill Logic (Smart Money Integration)The ICC Method and Wick Fill can be automated by looking for "Displacement" (aggressive candles) followed by a "Slow Correction."Rule ComponentHFC Detection LogicIndication (ChoCh)Price breaks a 20-day High/Low with a candle body $> 1.5 \times$ the average body size.Correction (AOI)A FVG is formed between Candle 1's High and Candle 3's Low. Price must re-enter this zone.ContinuationA 1-minute candle rejects the 50% "Mid-point" of the Wick or FVG.2. The "One Candle" & 4H Sweep AutomationThese two methods rely heavily on Time and Liquidity.Gate 6 (Opening Range): In your scanner, add a filter that marks the High/Low of the 9:30–9:45 AM EST candle.Gate 7 (Sweep Detector): Check the 4-Hour chart for a wick that extends beyond the previous session's high/low by at least 5-10 ticks but closes back inside.3. Updated "Hedge Fund" Master Prompt (ICT/SMC Edition)Copy this into your Replit Agent to merge Wick Sauce Ro’s strategy into your HFC tool:"Master Prompt: HFC v3.0 - Wick Sauce Edition1. Core Strategy Modules:ICC Engine: Identify 'Indication' candles (high displacement). Plot Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and broken structure levels (AOI).Wick-Fill Bot: Scan for 15M/1H wicks $> 50\%$ of the candle's total length. Trigger entry when price re-enters the bottom 25% of the wick.9:30 AM Range: Automatically mark the 15-minute Opening Range. Detect 5M breakouts and 1M retests.2. 4H Liquidity Sweep Filter: > * Monitor the 4-Hour timeframe. If a candle sweeps a session high/low and rejects, flip the directional bias for the 1M/5M scalper.3. Mismatch 'Kill Switch' (Wick Sauce Rules):EXIT IMMEDIATELY if price closes beyond the origin of the 'Indication' candle.EXIT if the target 'Wick Fill' or 'Opposite Liquidity' is hit (mechanical TP).4. Automation: Send Telegram alerts with 'A+ Setup' label when the 5-Gate System + ICC Method align perfectly."4.
