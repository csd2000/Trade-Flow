🚨 Urgent: Build Out ALL Training Modules (24 strategies) — End-to-End Completion
Goal (non-negotiable):
Deliver a fully working training system for 24 strategies, each with complete step-by-step written content, working navigation (incl. Back to Strategies), performant pages, admin editing, APIs, and database persistence. If original content exists, import it; if not, rebuild from the original prompts (text only). Do not break anything that already works.

1) Scope you must deliver
24 strategies × training tracks

Each strategy must be linked to a track_id and have a first_module_slug.

Each track must contain 6–8 modules (as appropriate), and every module must include:

title, duration, overview (paragraphs, not placeholders)

prerequisites[] (2+ items)

steps[] (5+ concrete steps in plain sentences)

notes_prompt

resources (video/pdf/community OR leave empty object {} if truly unavailable)

additional_resources[] optional

order, of, slug, track

If you can’t find the original text, rebuild from the original prompts (text only).

Pages & routing

Strategy cards → “Start Training” must route to
/academy/module/{track_id}/{first_module_slug}

Dynamic module page:
/academy/module/[track]/[slug]

Must render Overview, Prereqs, Steps, Notes prompt, Resources, Additional Resources, Prev/Next, and Print.

Back to Strategies button must return to the main strategies index without freezing.

Admin & CMS

/admin locked to emails in ADMIN_EMAILS.

/admin/content loads/saves JSON overrides to cms_content at path:
/academy/module/{track_id}/{module_slug}

Public pages must read CMS override first, then fallback to DB.

APIs & DB

GET /api/training/[track]/[slug] → returns the module JSON from DB (with override if present).

DB tables required (Supabase/Postgres):

training_tracks(track_id, title)

training_modules(track_id, slug, order, of, title, duration, overview, prerequisites jsonb, steps jsonb, notes_prompt, resources jsonb, additional_resources jsonb, previous jsonb, next jsonb)

strategies(id, slug, title, category, risk, roi_range, tags jsonb, summary, track_id, first_module_slug)

Plus cms_content and admin_audit_log (already provided).

Performance & UX

No page lockups; smooth back/forward navigation.

Side menu auto-hide + hover states; modern, readable theme.

Printing yields legible pages (no dark backgrounds on print CSS).

Keep anything that already works intact.

2) What you claimed vs. what I need verified
You stated:

“Seeded all 24 strategies… Created 192 training modules (8 per strategy)… Fixed routing… training-system-test…”

Action: Prove it with the checks below. If any check fails, finish the build and provide evidence.

3) Verification commands (copy & run)
3.1 Strategies linked to training
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Every one of the 24 strategies must have a track and a first module
select id, slug, track_id, first_module_slug
from public.strategies
order by id;

-- Missing links?
select slug from public.strategies
where track_id is null or first_module_slug is null;
3.2 Module counts per track
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Expect 6–8 modules per track; if you promised 8, verify 8
select track_id, count(*) as modules
from public.training_modules
group by track_id
order by track_id;

-- Any track under 6 modules = not built
select track_id from public.training_modules
group by track_id
having count(*) < 6;
3.3 Content completeness
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Modules missing real content (overview blank or < 80 chars)
select track_id, slug, length(coalesce(overview,'')) as ov_len
from public.training_modules
where length(coalesce(overview,'')) < 80;

-- Steps must be 5+ and non-empty sentences
select track_id, slug, jsonb_array_length(steps) as steps_len
from public.training_modules
where jsonb_array_length(steps) < 5;
3.4 API health
bash
Copy
Edit
# Replace with an actual track + slug that should exist
curl -sS https://YOUR-APP/ api/training/exit-strategy-training/exit-module-1 | jq .
curl -sS https://YOUR-APP/ api/training/fc-intelligent-training/fc-module-1 | jq .
3.5 Routes & UI (manual)
Visit:

/ (strategies index)

Click Start Training on multiple cards (FC Intelligent Decision, Exit Strategy, Passive Income, Warrior Trading, 30SecondTrader, etc.)

On a module page, click Back to Strategies → must land back on the index without freeze.

Click Next Module / Previous Module across an entire track.

4) If content is missing — how to rebuild (schema)
Use text only, following this JSON shape (per module):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "slug": "fc-module-1",
  "track": "fc-intelligent-training",
  "order": 1,
  "of": 8,
  "title": "Signal Inputs & Data Hygiene",
  "duration": "15 min",
  "overview": "Clear 2–3 sentences explaining the objective and context.",
  "prerequisites": ["List 2–4 concrete prerequisites"],
  "steps": [
    "Step 1 in full sentence.",
    "Step 2 in full sentence.",
    "Step 3 in full sentence.",
    "Step 4 in full sentence.",
    "Step 5 in full sentence."
  ],
  "notes_prompt": "One sentence prompt for journaling.",
  "resources": { "video": {"label": "Walkthrough", "url": "https://..."} },
  "additional_resources": []
}
Then upsert to training_modules. (You can also seed from trade_ninja_master_training_v3.json I supplied.)

5) Known required fixes
Back to Strategies: Ensure button routes to the index page used by the live app (no stale route names). Example React (Next.js):

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
const router = useRouter();
<button onClick={() => router.push("/")}>Back to Strategies</button>
If your index is /strategies, update accordingly.

Avoid lockups:

Ensure module page data fetch is client-safe and resilient (handle 404/500 gracefully).

Don’t chain state updates in effects that cause infinite re-renders.

Turn off dev overlay in prod builds.

Admin:

/admin must show Content Editor and Settings.

Content Editor loads and saves JSON to cms_content for any path.

Public pages first read CMS override at /academy/module/{track_id}/{slug}.

6) Deliverables (what I expect back)
DB proof:

Results/screenshots for the SQL checks above (module counts, missing links, content length, steps length).

Live routes:

Working URLs for at least 6 tracks’ module #1 pages (including fc-intelligent-training/fc-module-1).

UI demo:

A quick screen recording (or link to your “training-system-test” page) showing:

Start Training → Module

Prev/Next working

Back to Strategies working with no freeze

Admin demo:

/admin/content editing a module and seeing the override live on the public page.

7) Important constraints
Do not remove or break anything that already works.

If you cannot find original module text, rebuild from the original prompts today and seed the DB so pages render complete, printable content. No placeholders.

8) (Optional) Assets available from me
Master training DB with many tracks populated: trade_ninja_master_training_v3.json

Strategies mapping (24 cards → module 1):
strategies_seed_with_tracks_v3.sql / .json

Printable PDFs for each module (can be linked as resources.pdf)

I’m expecting completion that passes all verification checks above. If a check fails, fix and re-run until it’s clean.
