The Master PromptCopy and paste the block below into your Replit AI Agent:"Master Task: Architect and Implement a Tri-Factor Market Intelligence Engine for my Bitcoin Trading App.1. Objective: Build a central module market_intelligence.py that aggregates three distinct data layers to output a unified 'Market Health Score' (0-100).2. Core Components to Implement:Technical Layer: Use pandas_ta to calculate the 50/200 SMA (Golden Cross detection) and the RSI. Define a 'Bullish' state when Price > 200 SMA and RSI > 50.On-Chain Layer: Create a placeholder function get_onchain_sentiment() that calculates the ratio of Exchange Inflows vs. Outflows. (Output Bullish if Outflows > Inflows).Macro Layer: Create a configuration-based function get_macro_sentiment() that tracks Federal Reserve status (Dovish/Hawkish) and DXY (Dollar Index) trend.3. Integration Logic:Create a MarketAggregator class that weights these three layers (e.g., Technical 40%, On-Chain 30%, Macro 30%).Implement a get_master_signal() function that returns a JSON object with: signal (Strong Buy, Buy, Neutral, Sell), score, and reasoning.4. Implementation in Existing App: > * Update my main.py (or dashboard file) to import this class.Add a UI element (or print statement) that displays the 'Master Signal' and the breakdown of why the market is currently Bullish or Bearish.5. Constraints: Use clean, commented code. Use asynchronous functions (asyncio) for data fetching to ensure the app doesn't freeze while waiting for API responses."How this improves your AppBy using this prompt, Replit will structure your app like a professional trading platform. Instead of looking at a single chart, your app will now "think" like an institutional desk:Where to Insert the CodeOnce Replit generates the files, here is where they should live in your file tree:File NameRoleconfig.jsonStore your API keys for Macro data (FRED) and On-chain data (Glassnode/CryptoQuant).market_intelligence.pyThe "Brain." This is the new file the prompt creates to process the logic.main.pyThe "Executive." It calls the Brain and executes trades or updates the UI.
