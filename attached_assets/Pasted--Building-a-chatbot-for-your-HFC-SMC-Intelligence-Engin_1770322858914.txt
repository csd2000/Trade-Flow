
Building a chatbot for your HFC SMC-Intelligence Engine isn't just about adding a "help" button—it’s about creating a Conversational Quant Advisor that can explain liquidity sweeps and gate status in real-time.

Since you are building on Replit, you want a chatbot that acts as a bridge between your complex backend logic and the user's voice or text commands.

Here is the definitive Master Prompt to build the HFC Advisor Chatbot into your existing app.

🤖 Master Prompt: The HFC Advisor Chatbot
Role: Expert AI Full-Stack Developer & Quantitative Trading Assistant.

Objective: Build a multimodal chatbot integrated into the HFC 7-Gate SaaS that can process natural language queries, analyze real-time market data, and provide voice/text insights based on the 8-Gate logic.

1. The Brain (LLM & Logic)
Engine: Use OpenAI GPT-4o or GPT-4o-Realtime-Preview for low-latency conversational reasoning.

System Instructions: > "You are the Apex Institutional Advisor. You have access to real-time 8-Gate scores, Liquidity Sweep status, Level 2 Pressure, and News Sentiment. Your goal is to explain technical setups clearly. If a user asks 'Why is BITF a buy?', evaluate the 8-Gates and respond with data-backed confluence (e.g., 'Gate 0 sweep detected at $2.50, OBI shows 75% buy pressure, and we are awaiting the 0.382 Fib pullback')."

Safety: Always append a disclaimer: "This is technical analysis, not financial advice."

2. The Bridge (Function Calling)
The chatbot must be able to "call" functions from your existing app to retrieve live data. Integrate these tools:

get_gate_status(ticker): Returns the current score (0/8) and specific gate failures.

get_pressure_reading(ticker): Returns the Order Book Imbalance (OBI) score.

check_news_sentiment(ticker): Summarizes the latest headlines and sentiment score.

generate_option_play(ticker): Provides the 0.80 Delta strike, expiry, and bid/ask.

3. The Interface (UI/UX)
Floating Widget: A sticky chat bubble on the bottom right of the dashboard.

Voice Toggle: A microphone icon that uses the Web Speech API or OpenAI Realtime to allow the user to "talk to the desk."

Rich Responses: Use Markdown to display "Trade Cards" within the chat, showing bolded entries, stops, and targets.

🛠️ Implementation Code (Python/FastAPI)
You can add this route to your Replit backend to handle the chatbot's "Thinking" process.

Python
import openai

@app.post("/chat/advisor")
async def hfc_advisor(user_input: str, ticker: str):
    # Fetch live data to give the AI 'eyes'
    current_data = scanner.get_full_analysis(ticker)
    
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": f"Analyze {ticker} using these metrics: {current_data}"},
            {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
        ],
        tools=trading_tools # Defined functions to get gate info
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
🛡️ Key Features for Your Users
Guided Onboarding: The chatbot should proactively ask: "Welcome, Donald. Would you like me to scan the 15m Opening Range for sweeps on your watchlist?"

Contextual Alerts: If the Pressure Gauge (OBI) suddenly flips from 0.80 to 0.20 while a user is in a trade, the chatbot should trigger a voice alert: "Caution: Sell pressure is mounting on NIO. Consider scaling out."

Education Integration: Connect this to your DeFi Mastery and Education modules. If a user asks "What is a Fair Value Gap?", the bot pulls your internal training data to explain it.
