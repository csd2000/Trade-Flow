Last Inflation Report Pushed Markets To Record Highs In June: Could It Happen Again Friday? 5 ETFs To Watch
The inflation report that’s closely watched by the Federal Reserve — the Personal Consumption Expenditure price index — was published on May 31 for April data and sparked a fresh market rally in June, pushing major indexes to their all-time highs. As traders brace for Friday’s PCE price index report for May, scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET, many are wondering whether new favorable inflation data could bring the bulls back to Wall Street after some mixed performance in recent sessions. May’s PCE Report: What Do Economists Expect? The PCE price index is expected to decrease from 2.7% year-on-year in April to 2.6% in May, according to economist consensus data gathered by Econoday. On a monthly basis, the index is forecasted to rise at a 0.1% rate, down from the previous 0.3%. The core PCE price index is projected to drop from 2.8% to 2.6% year-on-year in May, potentially reaching its lowest level since March 2021. Monthly, it is expected to slow from 0.2% to 0.1%. If PCE inflation falls as expected or even more, it could bolster investor expectations of rate cuts, potentially ...Full story available on Benzinga.com

Stocks Show Modest Gains Ahead Of Fed's Inflation Report; Chipmakers Struggle, While Gold And Bitcoin Rebound: What's Driving Markets Thursday?
Wall Street experienced a subdued trading day on Thursday, as traders likely chose to remain on the sidelines in anticipation of Friday’s release of the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. In regulatory news, U.S. banks successfully passed the Federal Reserve’s 2024 stress tests. The results demonstrated that all analyzed institutions could maintain minimum capital requirements even in the face of a severe economic shock. Notably, regional banks, as tracked by the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE), performed relatively better overall compared to their larger counterparts. As of midday trading in New York, major indices showed marginal gains, with small caps outperforming large-cap indices. The semiconductor sector continued to face headwinds, with the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) down 0.7%, eyeing its fifth negative session in the last six. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) declined almost 2%. Treasury yields moved lower, reflecting increased demand for bonds ahead of the key inflation report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell by 4 ...Full story available on Benzinga.com

Gold Prices Set To Climb To $3,000 On Fed Rate Cuts, Geopolitical Tensions, Bank of America Says
Gold prices could skyrocket to $3,000 per ounce within the next 12 to 18 months, according to Bank of America’s latest analysis. Michael Widmer, a commodity strategist at the bank, suggests that a combination of factors — increasing investment demand, geopolitical tensions, Federal Reserve rate cuts and central bank purchases — could boost the yellow metal’s appeal among investors. Resurgence In Investor Demand In 2023, investor demand for gold saw a notable resurgence, the investment bank noted, with private bar hoarding and central bank acquisitions accounting for 49% and 43% of purchases, respectively. However, physically backed ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), have experienced a decline in assets under management, which has tempered overall demand growth. “A pick-up in LBMA clearing volumes would be an encouraging signal of rising non-commercial demand for gold, and would be consistent with higher prices needed to balance out the market,” Widmer said.

Bank Of America Predicts First Rate Cut In December: 'Higher-For-Longer Flavor'
Bank of America’s latest economic outlook for the U.S. paints a complex picture of steady but gradually fading economic growth, persistent inflation and a delayed start to the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts. The bank’s economist, Michael Gapen, emphasizes a “higher-for-longer” rates environment, with the first rate cut expected only in December.  Bank of America expects the factors that have driven the U.S. economy’s outperformance in recent years — such as robust labor force growth, employment catch-up effects, supportive fiscal policies and increased domestic manufacturing investment — to gradually fade. The bank projects a slowdown in real GDP growth from 3.1% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, 2.0% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026. Modestly restrictive financial conditions, tighter bank lending standards, diminishing wealth effects and a strong dollar are seen as significant headwinds. Persistent Inflation Concerns Inflation is expected to decelerate but remain sticky, particularly in the services sector. Gapen notes that while the rebound in the labor force exerts positive supply effects on inflation, it also leads to greater employment, income, and spending, which maintain demand pressures.

S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 Dip From Record Highs As Investors Take Chipmaker Profits; Energy Sector Rebounds, Yields Rise: What's Driving Markets Thursday?
After the Juneteenth holiday break, Wall Street reopened with a cautious tone, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices declined after hitting all-time highs around midday trading in New York. This decline was driven by profit-taking in chipmaker stocks and rising Treasury yields, which dampened risk sentiment. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) fell by 2.4%, marking its worst session since May 1, after reaching technically “overbought” levels earlier in the week. Oil prices surged above $81 a barrel, aiming for the highest close since late April. This was spurred by larger-than-expected drops in U.S. inventories last week, fueling a rally in oil-related companies. Small caps also softened, whereas blue chips saw a rebound, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average outperforming other major indices with a 0.4% gain. Long-dated Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield up by 5 basis points to 4.27%, following mixed economic data released earlier in the day. Jobless claims slightly increased more than expected last week, and a manufacturing activity gauge in the Philadelphia region fell short of estimates, reaching its lowest level in five months. Additionally, housing ...Full story available on Benzinga.com

Extremely Positive Sentiment On Lower PPI, Higher Jobless Claims, Musk Claim, And Broadcom Split
To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Lower PPI Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market took another leg up on Consumer Price Index (CPI) data yesterday. Please click here for details. The chart shows that after the Fed announcement, the stock market pulled back as the dot plot was more hawkish than expected. Please see click here for details. The chart shows that the stock market first jumped this morning on release of Producer Price Index (PPI) and jobless claims data. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is very overbought. Overbought markets tend to be susceptible to a pullback. The chart shows that the volume was higher yesterday than other recent low volume days, but the volume was not high enough considering the strong rally. This is a negative. Inflation at the producer level came cooler than expected. Here are the details: Headline PPI came at -0.2% vs. 0.1% consensus. Core PPI came at 0.0% vs. 0.3% consensus. In The Arora Report analysis, a big part of the drop in PPI is because of the following reasons: We have been sharing with readers that producer prices in China have been dropping. Since the U.S. imports a large amount of goods from China, China is exporting disflation to the U.S. Oil prices have fallen due to concerns about a weak economy. Oil contributes significantly to PPI. Weekly initial claims came at 242K vs. 224K consensus. This indicates that the jobs picture is weakening.  Initial jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories.  In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. The sentiment is extremely positive in addition to CPI, PPI, and jobless claims.  The following are adding to the positive sentiment.

Fed Chair Powell Tempers Market Excitement: 'We Want To Gain Further Confidence' On Inflation
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated during his June press conference that policymakers “want to gain further confidence” on inflation before considering interest rate cuts, slightly dampening market enthusiasm fueled by a lower-than-expected inflation report released earlier Wednesday. “So far this year, the data has not given us that greater confidence. The inflation data received earlier this year were higher than expected, though more recent monthly readings have eased somewhat,” Powell stated. Powell welcomed today’s reading but warned that upcoming inflation data may be “good but not [as] great” as the last one, given unfavorable base effects from the second half of 2023 which are likely to affect annual readings. Powell somehow cooled investor excitement over today’s reading: “That’s a step in the right direction. But one reading is only one reading.” Read also: Fed Holds Rates Steady: Projections Show Fewer Rate Cuts, Higher Inflation Outlook May Inflation Report Hasn’t Altered Fed’s New Inflation Outlook Powell explained that Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members had the opportunity to update their inflation forecasts in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com

May Inflation Report Clashes With Fed Meeting: Traders Brace For Volatile Wednesday
For the first time since June 2020, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released on the same day as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. This sets up a potentially volatile Wednesday for financial markets. Following three consecutive months of higher-than-expected inflation readings in the first quarter of 2024, April's data showed an easing in price pressures, aligning with forecasts. The new CPI data will thus be crucial in determining if inflationary pressures are continuing to decline, which could support hopes of reaching the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This heightens the significance of the May inflation report, due from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday. The outcome of the May inflation report will also heavily influence Fed Chair Jerome Powell's stance during his press conference on the same day. A softer inflation reading could bolster the case for interest rate cuts down the road this year, while a higher-than-expected number might necessitate a more aggressive approach, probably reiterating the need to keep rates high for longer. Market participants currently estimate a 50-50 chance of a rate cut in September, with expectations of only one fully priced rate cut by year-end.

Smart Money Trims Stocks On Strong Jobs Report - Raise Hedges, China Stops Buying Gold
To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Strong Jobs Report Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (ARCA:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: Cross currents in the stock market are increasing. Investors may need to handle increasing volatility due to cross currents. The best way to handle increasing volatility is to follow the protection band. Hedges are being raised.  The chart shows that after hitting the low band of the support zone, the stock market made a new high. This is technically a bullish pattern. The chart shows yesterday was the lowest volume day in a long time. This indicates a lack of conviction. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market can go either way. The chart shows that the stock market is selling off in the early trade on a stronger than expected jobs report. Here are the details of the jobs report: Nonfarm payrolls came at 272K vs. 186K consensus. Nonfarm private payrolls came at 229K vs. 168K consensus. Average hourly earnings came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus. Average work week came at 34.3 hours vs. 34.3 hours consensus. Unemployment rate came at 4.0% vs. 3.9% consensus. In The Arora Report analysis, the jobs report, when taken in totality along with the recent weak data from JOLTS and jobless claims, precludes the Fed from cutting rates at this time if the Fed is truly data dependent.   Momo gurus have been persuading their followers to buy stocks ahead of the jobs report because they claimed they knew the jobs report would be very weak.  Momo gurus are wrong again.  However, momo gurus have some ammunition for a new narrative to persuade their followers to continue to buy stocks. In The Arora Report analysis, here is the ammunition momo gurus can use: The unemployment rate rose. Household survey data was weaker. Much of the job creation was in government and service industries such as hospitality. Smart money is trimming stocks on the strong jobs report. Keep in mind that smart money owns very large stock positions. They just trim into the strength. In contrast, many in the ...Full story available on Benzinga.com

Blowout May Jobs Data 'Closes The Door On A July Rate Cut': 6 Economists Make Best Guesses On Fed's Next Move
The U.S. labor market showcased its resilience in May, with nonfarm payrolls surging by 272,000, far surpassing the anticipated 180,000. The upper range among economist predictions, as compiled by Econoday, was 225,000, so even the most optimistic forecasters had not anticipated the booming employment growth seen in Friday’s data. This robust increase occurred despite the unemployment rate inching up from April’s 3.9% to 4%. Average hourly earnings also came in hotter than expected, rising 4.1% year-over-year, which contributed to a significant increase in Treasury yields and a rally in the U.S. dollar index. As yields rocketed, long-dated bonds tanked, with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) down 1.8%, eyeing its worst session in two months. Gold also heavily dropped, pressured by rising Treasury yields and a strengthening dollar, with the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), tanking 2.5%, on track for its sharpest drop since February 2023. Strong Demand And Fed Policy Implications "This is a very strong report on the demand side," economist Mohamed El-Erian said on Bloomberg. The robust data effectively “closes the door on a July rate cut” by the Federal Reserve, El-Erian said. He emphasized that there is no possibility for the Fed to cut or even signal a cut in July, and he expects Fed Chair Jerome Powell to maintain maximum flexibility and data dependency. El-Erian also warned that keeping rates higher ...Full story available on Benzinga.com
