This is the Ultimate 7-Gate Master Prompt, consolidated and refined to include the specific "Best Scenario" parameters for option selection (Expiration, Strike, and Delta) based on our deep dive into high-velocity displacement.

The 7-Gate Replit Master Prompt (Final Version)
Core Philosophy
The system is a Momentum-Scalping Engine. It seeks to exploit the "Rubber Band Effect" that occurs after a Liquidity Sweep. By combining institutional displacement with high-delta options, the system aims for high-probability, quick-duration trades that avoid theta decay.

I. Option Selection: The "Best Scenario" Parameters
To support the 7-Gate logic, the system must filter for these specific contract metrics:

Target Delta: 0.60 to 0.65 (Ensures $1 move in underlying = $0.60+ in premium).

Expiration (DTE): 1–3 Days to Expiration. This captures the "Gamma" explosion during Gate 3 displacement without the extreme risk of 0DTE.

Strike Selection: In-The-Money (ITM). The first strike ITM is preferred to maintain intrinsic value.

Entry Type: Limit Order only (to capture the Gate 5 Retest).

II. The 7-Gate Execution Protocol
Gate 1: The Trigger (Liquidity Sweep)
Logic: Detect a "Sweep and Reclaim." Price must pierce a Daily High/Low or Session High/Low and immediately close back inside the range.

Priority: This is the only valid starting point. No sweep = No trade.

Gate 2: Institutional Confluence (S/D Zone)
Logic: The sweep must occur within or at the edge of a HTF (Higher Time Frame) Supply or Demand zone.

Gate 3: Velocity Displacement (The Engine)
Logic: Identify a "Signature Move." A candle body > 150% of the 20-period average body size.

Requirement: Must leave behind a Fair Value Gap (FVG). This proves the move is supported by 0.60 Delta-worthy momentum.

Gate 4: Market Structure Shift (MSS)
Logic: The "Seal of Approval." Price must achieve a full candle body close above/below the pivot high/low that created the sweep.

Gate 5: Return to Fair Value (The Entry)
Logic: Calculate the 50% Equilibrium of the Gate 3 leg.

Execution: Place a Limit Order at the confluence of the 0.5 Fib and the FVG. If price hits the 0.786 Fib before filling, the setup is invalidated (momentum lost).

Gate 6: Risk/Reward (Exit Strategy)
Stop Loss: 2 Ticks below the Sweep Low (Long) or High (Short).

Take Profit 1: Opposite Liquidity (the "Unswept" side).

Math: Minimum 2:1 R/R based on underlying price.

Gate 7: The Kill-Switch (Environment)
Windows: 9:30–11:30 AM EST & 1:30–4:00 PM EST.

News: Auto-disable 10 mins before/after High-Impact news (Red Folders).

Liquidity: Contract Bid-Ask spread must be < 2% of total premium.
