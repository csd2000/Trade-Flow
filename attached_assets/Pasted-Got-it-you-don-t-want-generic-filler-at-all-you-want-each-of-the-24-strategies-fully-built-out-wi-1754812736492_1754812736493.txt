Got it — you don’t want generic filler at all, you want each of the 24 strategies fully built out with the exact step-by-step, notes, prerequisites, and resources from the original prompts you already gave me earlier.

Here’s what we’ll tell Replit so they actually rebuild it properly this time:

📢 Message for Replit
Objective: Rebuild all 24 strategy modules using the specific, original training content Belinda provided earlier — no placeholders, no generic text.

1️⃣ Data Replacement
Discard any “template” or “Lorem ipsum” overviews/steps currently in the DB.

Pull the exact, detailed text from the original prompts Belinda provided for each strategy.
Example:

Passive Income Training → Use the yield farming, LP, vaults, APY calculations, risk mitigation steps I gave you in earlier prompts.

Oliver Velez Techniques → Use the exact professional entry/exit steps I gave before.

Profit Taking → Use my full bull-run ladder, ATR trail, and time-DCA instructions from my earlier messages.

If any strategy’s original prompt is missing, search my full conversation history for that strategy’s title — all of them were already spelled out before.

2️⃣ Structure
For each module (8 per strategy), ensure:

Overview: Full descriptive paragraph (≥80 characters) based on my original explanation.

Prerequisites: Specific skills/tools from my notes, not placeholders.

Steps: The exact step-by-step instructions I wrote — in my wording, not re-phrased generically.

Notes: Any watch-outs, pro-tips, or warnings I gave.

Resources: Actual links (video, PDF, chart examples) from my content, not generic “Watch video” filler.

Additional Resources: Keep my extra readings/charts if provided.

3️⃣ Database & Linking
Track IDs & First Module Slugs: All 24 strategies must have correct values so “Start Training” opens Module 1 of the correct track.

Seed the DB with the exact text content (not summaries) from my original messages.

Verify with:

sql
Copy
Edit
select count(*) from training_modules where length(overview) < 80; -- should be 0
select count(*) from training_modules where jsonb_array_length(steps) < 5; -- should be 0
4️⃣ Admin Editing
Keep /admin route for email-verified logins with full edit access to all module content.

Changes saved in CMS should override DB content live.

5️⃣ QA Checklist Before Delivery
Open /academy/module/{track}/{slug} for every module to verify my content is displayed exactly as I wrote it.

No placeholder “Watch video” unless I gave a specific video link.

No filler text for notes/resources — use mine.

Check navigation between modules & “Back to Strategies” works without reload errors.

If they follow this, we’ll end up with:
✅ 192 modules populated with my exact trading methods & details
✅ No generic filler anywhere
✅ Linked properly from the 24 strategy cards
✅ Editable by admin in real time

If you want, I can also compile all the original prompt content for each strategy into one JSON file right now so Replit can directly import it without hunting through the chat.
Do you want me to prepare that JSON package? That would make their job a one-step import.

Got it — we’ll make it crystal clear to Replit that:

Not all module content is showing — meaning some modules are empty or incomplete in the frontend.

They must fully build out every single module for every strategy using my original provided content, not placeholders.

Here’s how I’d phrase it for them:

📢 Message for Replit
Issue:

Many modules are currently empty or missing key sections (Overview, Steps, Notes, Resources).

Some modules don’t even render despite having DB entries — meaning there are frontend data-fetch/display issues as well.

Requirements:

Content Restoration / Build-Out

Re-import or rebuild all 192 training modules (8 modules × 24 strategies) using the exact original content provided earlier in prompts.

If you can’t locate the original content for a module, rebuild it directly from the original strategy prompt I gave, without skipping.

Every module must have:

Overview (≥ 80 chars, descriptive)

Prerequisites (tools, setup, knowledge required)

Step-by-step instructions (minimum 5, written exactly as given before)

Notes (warnings, tips, pitfalls)

Resources (video links, PDFs, charts)

Additional Resources if I originally provided them

No placeholders like “Watch video” or “Download PDF” unless those files/links exist and are linked.

Frontend Fixes

Ensure /academy/module/:track/:slug loads all sections of the content without empty states.

Fix any rendering issues where the API sends the data but the UI doesn’t display it.

Verify that all navigation works (“Next Module”, “Previous Module”, “Back to Strategies”).

Backend / DB

Verify all modules have track_id and first_module_slug so “Start Training” opens the correct module.

Run a query to confirm no empty overviews or steps:

sql
Copy
Edit
select count(*) from training_modules where length(overview) < 80;
select count(*) from training_modules where jsonb_array_length(steps) < 5;
All results must be 0 before delivery.

Admin Editing

Ensure admin panel (/admin) can edit all module content in real-time.

Changes should save to DB and update UI instantly without page reload.

Final QA Checklist

Every one of the 192 modules displays my actual strategy content.

No empty modules.

No broken navigation.

Admin can modify content without breaking formatting.
