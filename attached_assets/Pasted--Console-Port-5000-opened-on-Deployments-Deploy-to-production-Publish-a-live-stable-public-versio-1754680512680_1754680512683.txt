Make the side menu automatically hide and add hover effects
2 minutes of work
I've implemented the autohide side menu with enhanced hovering effects as requested:

✓ Autohide sidebar that expands on hover from 16px to 264px width
✓ Smooth 300ms animations with easing effects
✓ Enhanced hover effects on buttons with scale, shadow, and glow
✓ Professional tooltips with arrows when sidebar is collapsed
✓ Backdrop blur and shadow effects for modern appearance
✓ Animated expand/collapse indicator at bottom

The sidebar automatically hides when not in use and elegantly expands when you hover over it. All buttons have smooth hover animations with scaling and shadow effects. How does the new autohide navigation feel?

you have a scrolling so you can see the rest of the page and there's no sidebar side scrolling The trading card academy is overlapping the the sidebar. You have trading academy professional education on the sidebar window that comes up on autohigh and then you also have the professional trading academy at the top it look unprofessional and clunky Make it look professional and more colors nothing really dark Make it look professional.

Make this app look like the materialize figma dashboard UI kit with automatic design systems by Pixinvent. Once again make all of the trading portfolio academy work I want everything working I want the tracker working I want the profit calculator working a strategy builder D5 protocol working I want all 18 strategies working seamlessly with a scroll bar on the side so I can go up and down Make it look professional the colors everything look would look A1 then make it look like that figma dashboard UI kit
