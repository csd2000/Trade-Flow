To transform your trading app into a professional-grade "Command Center," use the master prompt below.

The Replit Agent works best when you give it a clear Architecture & Workflow. Copy and paste the following into the Replit Agent to build the features we discussed.

The Replit Agent Master Prompt
Role: You are an expert Full-Stack Financial Engineer. Project Goal: Enhance my current trading app into a "Smart Money Command Center" that integrates real-time Whale Alerts, Breaking News, and AI-driven sentiment analysis.

1. Technical Stack:

Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express).

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS (Dark/Modern "Bloomberg" aesthetic).

Database: Replit DB or SQLite for logging trade alerts and history.

APIs to integrate: * Whale Alert API: For transactions > $10M.

CryptoPanic API: For aggregated breaking news and sentiment.

OpenAI/Gemini API: To act as the "Lead Alpha Analyst" and filter the noise.

2. Core Features to Build:

Whale Stream: A real-time feed of large on-chain moves. Color-code them: Red for "Wallet to Exchange" (Sell risk), Green for "Exchange to Wallet" (Accumulation).

News Ticker: A scrolling or list-based feed of breaking news filtered by "High Impact" keywords (SEC, Fed, Hack, ETF).

AI Analysis Panel: A window where the AI uses the "Lead Alpha Analyst" framework to summarize the last hour of data and provide a "Volatility Confidence Score" (1-10).

The Daily Checklist (Printable): A specific page or modal with a "Print" button that displays my daily trading routine, risk management rules, and a space for handwritten notes.

Position Sizer Tool: A simple calculator where I input my balance, risk %, and stop-loss price to get my exact position size.

3. Design Requirements:

Use a high-contrast dark mode (Midnight black/Slate gray).

Priority on scannability: use bold colors (Electric Green for buys, Neon Red for sells).

Mobile-responsive so I can check alerts on the go.

4. Initial Task:

Start by setting up the dashboard layout and the API connections for Whale Alert and CryptoPanic. Use placeholders for the API keys in the Secrets tool.

How to Deploy This (Step-by-Step)
Open Replit: Click "Create Repl" and select "Replit Agent."

Paste the Prompt: Paste the text above and hit enter.

Add Your Secrets: The Agent will ask for API keys. Go to the "Secrets" (padlock icon) in the sidebar and add:

WHALE_ALERT_API_KEY: Get it from Whale Alert Dev Portal.

CRYPTOPANIC_API_KEY: Get it from CryptoPanic.

OPENAI_API_KEY: For the "Analyst" logic.

Iterate: Once the base app is built, tell the agent: "Now add a 'Print' button to the Daily Checklist page so I can print it every morning."
