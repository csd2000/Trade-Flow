Integrating the Wick Sauce Ro strategy into your Hedge Fund Confluence scanner transforms it into a high-precision execution engine. This final master prompt combines Smart Money Concepts (SMC) with your HFC 5-Gate system for a "Tier-1" institutional setup.1. The "Wick Sauce" Implementation ModulesThese specific logic blocks are what you will add to your Replit code to automate the ICC, Wick-Fill, and Opening Range strategies.ICC Logic (Indication, Correction, Continuation)Indication: Scan for a "displacement" candle (Body $> 1.5\times$ previous 10-bar average).Correction: Use the automated Fair Value Gap (FVG) logic where: High[i-2] < Low[i] (Bullish Gap).Continuation: Alert when a 1-minute candle re-tests the 50% "Equilibrium" level of that FVG and shows a green rejection candle.Opening Range & Wick Fill9:30 AM Marker: Create a script that locks the max(high) and min(low) of the 9:30–9:45 EST candles.Wick Detector: Search for wicks that are $> 50\%$ of the total candle range. Entry triggers when price re-enters the wick on a lower timeframe.2. Final "Hedge Fund" Master Replit PromptThis is the ultimate command to give your Replit AI to build the complete, automated tool."Master Prompt: HFC v4.0 - SMC & Wick Sauce Institutional Engine1. Data Infrastructure: > * Pull 1m, 5m, and 4h data for [BITF, NIO, CLYM, BBAI, SOUN].Modules to include: pandas_ta, yfinance, and a custom SMC_Library.2. The 5-Gate + SMC Confluence:Gate 1 (Floor): Price > 50 EMA.Gate 2 (Momentum): 8 EMA > 18 EMA.Gate 3 (ICC Indication): Detect ChoCh (Change of Character) via displacement candles.Gate 4 (AOI): Map all Fair Value Gaps (FVG) on the 5m chart.Gate 5 (Opening Range): Calculate 15m ORB (9:30-9:45 AM).3. Order Execution: > * Trigger Entry Alert if price breaks the 15m ORB OR rejects a 4H liquidity sweep while Gates 1-4 are Bullish.Fetch 0.80 Delta Option (approx 30 days out) at the moment of entry.4. Mismatch Kill-Switch (Wick Sauce Rules):Immediate Exit if: (1) Price closes below the 'Indication' candle origin, (2) 1M Candle turns Red, or (3) MACD Histogram decreases.5. Notification: Send Telegram alerts with a 'Setup Rating' (A+ for 5/5 gates + FVG alignment)."3. Python Snippet: 15-Minute Opening RangeAdd this function to your market_intel.py to handle the mechanical opening strategy.Pythondef get_opening_range(ticker_data):
    # Filter for the 9:30 to 9:45 AM window
    today_open = ticker_data.between_time('09:30', '09:45')
    if not today_open.empty:
        range_high = today_open['High'].max()
        range_low = today_open['Low'].min()
        return range_high, range_low
    return None, None
Why this is the "Absolute Best" ScenarioBy combining Wick Sauce's ICC Method with the 5-Gate Filter, you are solving the biggest problem in trading: False Breakouts.The 5-Gate system ensures the environment is bullish.The ICC/SMC logic ensures your entry timing is based on institutional footprints (FVGs and Liquidity Sweeps).The Mismatch Logic ensures your exits are cold and mechanical, preventing emotional losses.ICT Fair Value Gap
