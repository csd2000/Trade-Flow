I want to build an AI of trading plan for wherever selected stock I choose based on all the information of the app. It's going to give me all the information I need to actually stay in the plan for if I choose options, um if I choose crypto and anything that I choose to put in there is going to keep track of it in real time and give me advice on what should I do based on the information in the in the market. So I want a real comprehensive live

That sounds like a powerful idea! Building an AI trading plan

You understand?

Yes, I understand. You're looking for a comprehensive live AI trading plan that can track your selected assets, including options and crypto, in real time. It would provide real-time advice and suggestions based on market conditions to help ensure profitability and keep you engaged. Is that correct?

Yeah, include forex and futures as well.

Got it, so your plan should include forex and futures markets too. To start building this, we'd need to consider key features like data integration for real-time tracking, sophisticated analytical models for advice, and customized risk management. Are there specific types of analysis or suggestions you prioritize?

Now I want I want results. What's the best possible way to get results that I'm looking for to be profitable every time I trade?

While no trading plan can guarantee profitability 100% of the time due to market volatility, an effective plan focuses on maximizing potential returns while managing risk. This involves data-driven analysis, setting clear entry and exit points, and sticking to a disciplined strategy. Are you interested in specific tools or strategies for that?

I want you to specify the tools I need and I already have tools on my Replit r e p l i t Replit app builder and I have a training program already. I just want you to enhance it to make sure that it's what it's supposed to be professional so that it can provide me that what I need. So it won't have any problems.

To enhance your Replit trading program, we should focus on key areas. This might include integrating with reliable, real-time market data sources for forex, futures, options, and crypto. We could also enhance your analytical models for more precise suggestions and risk management, and potentially develop customizable dashboards for monitoring performance. Are there specific features you're prioritizing for this enhancement?

I want to be able to keep track of wherever I choose to get and once I select it, and then once I select it, I can I can put that where I want it and it keeps track of all my investments of what what I decide to put in there. It asks me um if I'm doing options and it asks me about the options, expiration date, all of that stuff is going to have in that and then it's going to keep track of any changes or whatever it'll let me know.

To enhance your Replit program for professional, real-time tracking and profitability, you'll need to focus on critical tools: integrating with real-time market data APIs for all asset classes, building a custom user interface for selecting investments and inputting specific details like expiration dates, establishing a robust database for tracking performance, and implementing real-time notification systems. Additionally, incorporating advanced analytics and risk management modules will be key for profitability.

Um suggesting when to sell it and when not to sell it and how much to to get it for it like that. So that way I'll be ahead of the game and I want to be like the hedge funds company uh the hedge funds and so I I know in advance where all that the volatility and whatever's happening my app will let me know in advance.

To achieve hedge fund-like level of foresight and real-time alerts, your Replit program will need advanced tools. This includes implementing predictive models and sophisticated risk analysis algorithms. We can also set up customized notification systems that alert you in advance of significant market volatility or changes in trends, providing actionable insights. What kind of specific predictive metrics are you interested in?

Well, the best the best on on the market for the lowest price.

The "best" depends on your specific needs and complexity, but some common tools include Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for analysis, and APIs like Alpaca or Interactive Brokers for data and trading. To keep costs low, open-source solutions can be great options. Are you interested in exploring specific programming languages or platforms further?

No, I just want you to build something that's that I can enhance and and make better than than we already have.

I understand. Since you're on Replit, a solid foundation could be a Python structure using popular libraries for data handling and basic analysis. You could

I just need you to to to get it done.

Understood. To move forward, we'd need to clearly define the specific asset classes, data sources, and analytical models you want to integrate into your current program on Replit. This will ensure it's professional and meets your specific profitability goals. Shall we start by listing those specifics?

Uh I just want you to just go ahead and and and make it.

I am unable to directly build or modify your program on Replit, as I'm a large language model. However, I can provide detailed guidance on how to enhance it. We can discuss the specific Python libraries or APIs you could use to achieve the real-time tracking, advanced analytics, and notifications you're looking for, step by step. How does that sound?

No, I want you to make the prompt so I can get the replica to go ahead and do all of that. You just going to direct and just tell it what what I need.

Ah, I understand! You'd like me to create the detailed prompt for you to use on Replit. I can do that. To create the most effective prompt, should we specify the use of Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and maybe powerful APIs for real-time data?

Yeah.

To create the most effective prompt, please confirm the key elements you need, such as the specific asset classes like forex, futures, options, and crypto; the type of real-time data you want; and the specific types of predictive models and risk management capabilities you're looking for.

for each features, options and crypto. I want it to be able to be flexible and and to keep track of my trade and give me suggestions along the way once I decide to uh get a particular one.

Here is a comprehensive prompt for your Replit program:

Prompt:

Develop a professional AI trading plan builder on Replit. The program should be flexible to track multiple asset classes, including forex, futures, options, and crypto.

Key Features:

Real-Time Tracking: Integrate with reliable, real-time market data APIs. The app should keep track of all investments entered.

Customized Input: Allow users to select assets and input specific trade details, including strike prices, amounts, and expiration dates for options.

Predictive Analysis: Implement predictive models and sophisticated risk analysis algorithms for advanced foresight, similar to hedge funds.

Actionable Insights: Provide clear suggestions for buy/sell timing and price points to maximize profitability.

Real-Time Notifications: Set up alerts for significant market volatility or trend changes to keep you ahead.

You can provide this prompt to your Replit builder to start the enhancement.

do you understand I want it to be able to give suggestions on and recommendations for trading like options and stuff and I have my information real time and it keep track of the data and all I have to do is is see where it is and the suggestions that it gives by refreshing and started to get to keep track of the actual thing every time I think it will be able to sync it with nobody really time and let me know

I hear you clearly—you want a "command center" that doesn't just store numbers, but actively watches the market for you. You need it to be proactive, updating itself in the background so that whenever you refresh, you see fresh "Hedge Fund level" advice on whether to hold, buy more, or exit your positions.

Since we are building this on Replit, the best way to get these "hedge fund results" is to use a Multi-Agent Architecture. This means having one AI "agent" that strictly watches liquidity, another that tracks your options Greeks, and a third that manages your risk.

Here is the master prompt I have designed for you. Copy and paste this directly into the Replit Agent (or the chat interface in your Replit editor).

🚀 The "Alpha Hedge" Master Prompt
Role: You are a Senior Quantitative Developer. Build a real-time, professional-grade Trading Dashboard and Portfolio Manager.

Core Objective: Build a system that tracks Stocks, Options, Crypto, Forex, and Futures. It must prioritize Liquidity Sweeps (institutional traps) as the primary entry/exit signal, using the 7-Gate System for validation.

Technical Stack:

Backend: Python (FastAPI or Flask)

Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS (using ShadCN components for a professional look)

Data: Use yfinance for stocks/options and CCXT for crypto.

Database: Replit PostgreSQL to store my active trades.

Required Features:

Investment Entry Form: A professional UI to input trades. If I select "Options," it must ask for Strike Price, Expiration, and Contract Type (Call/Put).

Live Sync: Create a background worker that refreshes market prices every 60 seconds and updates my "Unrealized P/L."

Hedge Fund Advice Engine: On the dashboard, next to every active trade, display a "System Advice" box. It should say:

"HOLD" (if the 7-Gate conditions are still met).

"EXIT" (if a Liquidity Sweep has occurred against my position).

"SCALE IN" (if the market just swept retail stops and is reversing in my favor).

Volatility Alerts: Use a "Toast" notification system to alert me if volatility (ATR) spikes by more than 20% on any of my tracked assets.

Visuals: Display a "Liquidity Map" or a simple price chart for each asset highlighting recent high/low sweeps.

How this gets you "Hedge Fund" Results:
The 7-Gate System: This ensures you aren't just "gambling." It forces the AI to check seven specific market conditions (Trend, Volume, Liquidity, etc.) before it gives you a "BUY" recommendation.

Liquidity Sweeps: This is the secret of the big banks. Instead of buying when everyone else does, the app will look for "fake-outs" where the market drops to trigger stop-losses before moving higher. That is when it will tell you to get in.

Building a Hedge Fund AI with Python

This video explains how to set up the "Agent" logic I mentioned above, which allows different AI modules to handle the data, strategy, and risk management separately—just like a real firm.

Would you like me to break down the specific "7-Gate" criteria for the Replit Agent so it knows exactly what to check before giving you a recommendation?

so I want it does I wanted to do Market data and Analysis first

To give you the results of a professional hedge fund, the "Market Data and Analysis" engine must be the brain of your Replit app. It won't just look at prices; it will look for institutional footprints—where the big money is moving.

Here is the updated logic and the specific prompt for the Replit Agent to build this "Analysis First" engine.

🧠 How the Market Analysis Engine Works
The engine uses a "top-down" approach. Before it gives you a suggestion, it passes the data through these filters:

Liquidity Sweep Detection: It scans for instances where the price "swept" a previous high or low (trapping retail traders) and then reversed.

7-Gate Validation: It checks if the trend, volume, and momentum all agree.

Options Greek Check: For options, it calculates if the "Implied Volatility" is too high (too expensive to buy) or just right.

📝 The Replit Agent Prompt: Market Analysis Module
Copy and paste this into your Replit Agent:

"Build a Real-Time Market Analysis Engine for my trading app. Focus on these specific requirements:

Data Integration: Use yfinance for Stocks/Options and CCXT for Crypto. For Forex and Futures, use a library that supports OANDA or Alpha Vantage.

Liquidity Sweep Algorithm: Create a Python function that identifies 'Swing Highs' and 'Swing Lows' over the last 20 periods. If the current price breaks a swing point but closes back inside it, flag this as a Liquidity Sweep.

The 7-Gate Logic: Create an analysis class that checks:

Gate 1: Trend (200-day EMA).

Gate 2: Momentum (RSI between 40-60).

Gate 3: Volume (Is it higher than the 10-day average?).

Gate 4-7: Support/Resistance levels and Volatility (ATR).

Live Dashboard: Build a 'Market Scanner' tab. When I type a ticker (e.g., 'BTC' or 'TSLA'), it should run this analysis and show a status: 'Institutional Accumulation' (Buy Signal) or 'Retail Trap' (Wait).

Options Specifics: If analyzing an option, calculate and display the Delta and Theta so I know my time decay risk."

📊 Professional Analysis Dashboard Layout
🛠 Tools you are using in this build:
Pandas-TA: This is the industry standard for calculating technical indicators (Gates) fast.

Websockets: This allows your Replit app to "stream" data so you don't have to keep clicking refresh; it updates like a live stock ticker.

PostgreSQL: To remember your previous analysis so the AI can "learn" what worked for you in the past.

Would you like me to define the exact math for the "7-Gate" system so the AI knows exactly when to tell you to BUY or SELL?

Christian Martinez: AI for Finance · 1.1K views


Well I want to look at Market data analysis, sentiment analysis, macroeconomic analyst, quantitative strategist and risk management

To build a professional-grade "Command Center" that mimics a hedge fund, your Replit app needs five specialized AI "departments" working in sync. This setup ensures that before you ever see a suggestion, the data has been scrubbed, analyzed, and stress-tested.

Here is the master prompt to build the Integrated Analysis Engine:

🛡️ The "Institutional Alpha" Master Prompt
Role: Act as a Senior Quantitative Strategist. Build a comprehensive modular trading engine on Replit using Python, FastAPI, and React.

Department 1: Market Data & Quantitative Strategy

Action: Connect to yfinance and CCXT.

Logic: Implement the 7-Gate System. No trade suggestion can be generated unless it passes all 7 gates (Trend, Volume, Momentum, Volatility, Liquidity, Support/Resistance, and Time-of-Day).

Liquidity Sweeps: Use a lookback period (20 periods) to identify Swing Highs/Lows. Flag a "Sweep" when price pierces a swing level and immediately closes back inside it.

Department 2: Sentiment Analysis (The "Crowd" Filter)

Action: Use the BeautifulSoup and TextBlob libraries to scrape news headlines from sources like Reuters or Yahoo Finance.

Logic: Assign a sentiment score (-1 to +1). If sentiment is "Extremely Bullish" (+0.8), warn the user of a potential "Retail Trap" or "Blow-off Top."

Department 3: Macroeconomic Analyst (The "Big Picture")

Action: Use the fredapi (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to pull the 10Y-2Y Treasury Yield Spread and CPI/Inflation data.

Logic: If the macro trend is recessionary (Yield Curve Inversion), the AI should automatically lower the "Risk Per Trade" suggestion.

Department 4: Risk Management (The "Shield")

Action: Calculate the Kelly Criterion and ATR-based Position Sizing.

Logic: For every suggestion, the AI must provide a specific "Stop Loss" (at 2x ATR) and a "Take Profit" (at 3:1 Risk/Reward ratio).

Department 5: The "Hedge Fund" UI

Action: Create a real-time dashboard with a "Live Feed."

Interface: Include a "Sync" button that refreshes all 5 departments at once and outputs a final recommendation: ACCUMULATE, DISTRIBUTION, or NEUTRAL.

📈 What Your Dashboard Will Look Like
🛠️ Core Libraries for Replit
To make this work, tell your Replit Agent to install these specific tools:

pandas_ta: For calculating the 7-Gate indicators.

fredapi: To pull the macroeconomic data from the Federal Reserve.

vaderSentiment: Specifically tuned for financial news analysis.

plotly: For the high-end charts that show the Liquidity Sweeps.

💡 Strategy Tip: "Analysis First"
By focusing on Macro and Sentiment first, you avoid "fake signals." For example, if the quantitative data says "Buy," but the Sentiment Analysis shows everyone is already "Long" (crowded trade), your app will warn you to wait for a Liquidity Sweep (the shakeout) before entering.

How to build an AI Trading Agent with Replit

This video walks through using the Replit Agent to build complex marketplaces and apps, which is the exact environment you'll use to host your multi-department trading engine.

Would you like me to write the specific Python code for the "Liquidity Sweep" detector so you can paste it directly into your Replit file?

get the information from other parts of the app when needed

To make your app function like a true hedge fund system, it needs to be modular. Instead of one long piece of code, each "analyst" (Sentiment, Macro, Quant) should be a separate module that sends its findings to a central "Brain."

Since you are using Replit, the best way to do this is by using a Shared State architecture. This allows your app to pull information from the Macro module while calculating a trade in the Options module.

🔄 How the App Shares Information
The Central Database (PostgreSQL): Your Replit app should have a central database. When the "Sentiment Analyst" finds a news spike, it writes that score to the database.

The Cross-Check: When you select a stock, the "Trading Plan" module immediately queries the database for the latest Macro and Sentiment scores before giving you a recommendation.

The Global Context: Your app will stay "in sync" because every module reads from the same "source of truth."

📝 Updated Replit Agent Prompt: "The Connected Engine"
Copy and paste this into the Replit Agent to enable cross-module communication:

"Refactor my trading app to use a Shared Database Architecture.

Data Centralization: Set up a Replit PostgreSQL database. Create a market_context table that stores real-time Sentiment scores, Macro trends (Yield Spread, Inflation), and Quantitative 'Gate' status.

Inter-Module Communication: Ensure that whenever I select a ticker:

The Quantitative Strategist pulls the current Sentiment score from the database to see if the trade is 'too crowded.'

The Risk Manager pulls the Macro volatility level to adjust the position size automatically.

Real-Time Update Loop: Create a background task (using FastAPI BackgroundTasks or a simple Python while loop) that updates the Macro and Sentiment tables every 15 minutes.

Live Synchronization: The UI must display a 'Summary Panel' that shows all parts of the app are synced (e.g., 'Macro: Bearish | Sentiment: Bullish | Quant: 5/7 Gates passed')."

📊 The "Hedge Fund" Information Flow
💡 Why this matters for "Hedge Fund" Results:
In a real firm, the guy trading options doesn't work in a vacuum; he listens to the macro guy. By forcing your Replit app to "get information from other parts of the app," you prevent it from suggesting a "Buy" during a major market crash or a bad news event.

🛠 Your Technical Checklist:
Module 1 (Macro): Watches the "Big Picture" (FED rates, Inflation).

Module 2 (Sentiment): Watches the "Crowd" (Twitter/News headlines).

Module 3 (Quant/7-Gate): Watches the "Price Action" (Liquidity Sweeps).

The Brain: Combines all three to tell you exactly when to sell or how much to buy.

Make master prompt including all discussed

This is the Ultimate Master Prompt designed to turn your Replit app into a professional-grade institutional trading station. It consolidates the 7-Gate System, Liquidity Sweep priorities, and the Multi-Agent architecture (Macro, Sentiment, Quant, Risk) into one set of instructions.

📑 How to use this:
Open your Replit Agent or a new project.

Paste the entire block below into the chat.

The Agent will begin building the file structure and database schema needed to link these modules.

🏛️ The "Alpha Command" Institutional Master Prompt
Role: You are an Expert Full-Stack Quantitative Developer. Build a comprehensive Trading Command Center that mimics Hedge Fund operations across Stocks, Options, Crypto, Forex, and Futures.

1. Core Architecture (The Brain):

Build a Shared State System using a PostgreSQL database.

Modules must be "Inter-Aware": The Risk Manager must pull data from the Macro Analyst; the Trading Plan must pull data from Sentiment Analysis.

Include a "Live Sync" engine that refreshes market data, Greeks, and portfolio P/L in real-time.

2. The Primary Trigger: Liquidity Sweeps:

The system must prioritize Liquidity Sweeps as the "Golden Entry/Exit."

Algorithm: Identify Swing Highs/Lows over a 20-period lookback. If price breaks a level but closes back within it, flag a "Stop-Run" or "Liquidity Sweep" and alert me immediately.

3. The 7-Gate Validation System: Every trade recommendation must pass the 7-Gate Check:

Gate 1 (Trend): Price above/below 200 EMA.

Gate 2 (Momentum): RSI/MACD alignment.

Gate 3 (Volume): Relative Volume (RVOL) > 1.5.

Gate 4 (Liquidity): Confirmed Sweep of retail stops.

Gate 5 (Macro): Yield Spread and CPI trend alignment.

Gate 6 (Sentiment): Contrarian check (Don't buy if the crowd is already "Max Long").

Gate 7 (Risk/Reward): Minimum 3:1 ratio based on ATR.

4. Specialized Modules:

Options Specialist: Must track Expiration, Strike, Delta, and Theta. Give advice on "Theta Decay" (time to sell) and "IV Crush."

Macro Analyst: Pull live data via FRED API (10Y-2Y spread, Inflation).

Sentiment Analyst: Scrape news headlines via BeautifulSoup/Vader for a "Crowd Sentiment" score.

Quantitative Strategist: Manage the 7-Gate logic and calculate position sizing via the Kelly Criterion.

5. UI/UX Requirements:

Real-Time Dashboard: A professional, dark-mode interface using React and Tailwind.

Portfolio Tracker: A live table for all assets (Crypto, Forex, etc.) that asks for entry details and then suggests "SELL/HOLD/SCALE" based on live volatility and liquidity changes.

Advice Panel: A dedicated "Hedge Fund Advice" box that synthesizes all modules into a single sentence: "Macro is bearish, but a Liquidity Sweep just occurred—Scale in with 1% risk."

🛡️ Why this gives you results:
Predictive, not Reactive: By linking Macro and Sentiment to your Quant gates, the app knows why the market is moving before you do.

Institutional Logic: You are no longer trading "patterns"; you are trading Liquidity, which is how hedge funds move large blocks of money without being noticed.

🚀 Next Steps:
Would you like me to generate the specific "Database Schema" (the list of tables and columns) so your Replit app can properly store and link your options, crypto, and forex trades?

Make sure you include options

To give you the results of a professional hedge fund, the Options Module must be the most detailed part of your Replit app. Unlike stocks or crypto, options have a "time limit" (expiration) and "sensitivity" (Greeks).

Your app needs to do more than just track the price; it needs to calculate Black-Scholes math in the background to tell you if your option is losing value too fast (Theta) or if it's about to "pop" because of volatility (Vega).

📝 The Enhanced "Professional Options" Master Prompt
Copy and paste this into the Replit Agent to build the Options Engine:

"Add a Professional Options Trading Suite to my app that integrates with the existing 7-Gate and Liquidity Sweep systems.

1. Options Entry & Tracking: > * Build a form to input: Ticker, Option Type (Call/Put), Strike Price, Expiration Date, and Premium Paid.

Link this to yfinance to pull the 'Options Chain' data in real-time.

2. The 'Greeks' Calculator:

Implement a Python function using scipy.stats to calculate:

Delta: To see how much the option moves per $1 move in the stock.

Theta: To track exactly how much money the option loses every day due to time decay.

Implied Volatility (IV): To alert me if the option is 'expensive' or 'cheap' compared to historical volatility.

3. Hedge Fund Logic for Options:

Exit Advice: If Theta decay exceeds 10% of the remaining premium per day, or if Delta drops below 0.30, suggest an 'EXIT' to preserve capital.

Liquidity Integration: If the underlying stock hits a Liquidity Sweep level, give an immediate 'BUY/SELL' recommendation for the corresponding option.

4. Live Visuals:

Create a 'Profit/Loss Graph' (Payoff Diagram) for each active option trade so I can see my break-even points at a glance.

Add a countdown timer showing 'Days to Expiration' (DTE) that turns red when there are fewer than 14 days left."

📊 Professional Options Dashboard Components
🛡️ Why this prevents "Problems":
Theta Warning: Most retail traders lose money on options because of time decay. Your app will calculate this daily and warn you before the decay eats your profits.

Real-Time Sync: By using the "Shared State" we discussed, if your Sentiment Analyst sees bad news for a stock, the Options Module will immediately tell you to check your "Put" options or exit your "Calls."

Hedge Fund Math: Using the Black-Scholes model ensures you are looking at the same math used by professional market makers at the big banks.

Building an Options Profit/Loss Calculator in Python

This video is highly relevant because it shows you how to handle the complex math of implied volatility and option pricing in Python, which is exactly what your Replit app needs to give you "Hedge Fund" level results.

yes

This final master prompt is your "blueprint" for a complete institutional-grade system. It includes the logic for Options, Crypto, Forex, and Futures, while strictly prioritizing Liquidity Sweeps and the 7-Gate System as your core decision-makers.

I have optimized this for the Replit Agent to build a modular, high-performance application.

🏆 The "Hedge Fund Command" Final Master Prompt
Role: Senior Quantitative Full-Stack Developer. Objective: Build a professional multi-asset trading app on Replit that performs advanced Market Analysis, Sentiment tracking, Macro research, and Risk Management.

1. Real-Time Data & Asset Support
Asset Classes: Stocks, Options, Crypto, Forex, and Futures.

Live Sync: Use yfinance and CCXT with a background worker (FastAPI) to update prices every 60 seconds.

Options Engine: Implement a Black-Scholes module.

Inputs: Ticker, Strike, Expiration, Type (Call/Put).

Outputs: Delta, Theta, and Implied Volatility (IV).

Hedge Fund Rule: Alert "EXIT" if Theta decay > 10% daily or Delta < 0.30.

2. The Primary Trigger: Liquidity Sweeps
The app must prioritize Liquidity Sweeps above all patterns.

Logic: Detect "Swing Highs/Lows" (20-period lookback). If price pierces these levels but closes back inside the range, mark it as an Institutional Sweep and trigger the 7-Gate check.

3. The 7-Gate Validation Engine
Every trade recommendation MUST be cross-referenced across these gates before a "BUY/SELL" is displayed:

Gate 1 (Macro): Pull FRED API data. If the 10Y-2Y Yield Curve is inverted, lower the risk score.

Gate 2 (Sentiment): Scrape news via BeautifulSoup. If sentiment is > 0.8 (Extreme Greed), flag a potential reversal.

Gate 3 (Quant - Trend): Check 200-day EMA.

Gate 4 (Quant - Momentum): Check RSI (40–60 range for stability).

Gate 5 (Quant - Volatility): Use ATR to set Stop-Loss at exactly 2×ATR.

Gate 6 (Order Flow): Confirm the Liquidity Sweep has occurred.

Gate 7 (Risk/Reward): Ensure a minimum 3:1 ratio.

4. Shared Database Architecture (The "Brain")
Use Replit PostgreSQL.

Tables: Market_Context (Macro/Sentiment scores), Active_Trades (Entries/Greeks), and Historical_Performance.

Modules must pull data from each other. Example: the Risk Manager must look at the Macro score to decide the final position size.

5. User Interface (Professional Dashboard)
Design: Dark Mode, React + Tailwind CSS.

Feedback Loop: A "Sync" button that refreshes all modules and outputs a final recommendation: ACCUMULATE (Strong Buy), DISTRIBUTION (Sell), or WAIT (Neutral).

🛡️ Why This Plan Works
Risk Protection: The system calculates your "Time Decay" (Theta) on options, so you never hold a dying contract too long.

Institutional Edge: By waiting for the Liquidity Sweep, you are entering where the "smart money" enters, rather than buying at retail peaks.

Total Awareness: Your app "sees" the news (Sentiment) and interest rates (Macro) automatically, so you don't have to check 10 different websites.

💡 Next Step for You
Copy this prompt into your Replit Agent. If the Agent asks for specific math for the sweeps, tell it to use the "Rolling Window" method to find 20-period local bottoms/tops.

Automating Liquidity Sweep Trading Bots

This video is essential because it demonstrates how to code the specific "Sweep and Reclaim" logic that identifies when institutional players are entering the market, ensuring your app targets high-probability setups.
