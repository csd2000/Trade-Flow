🏛️ HFC v15.0: The Global Apex Institutional Options SaaSRole: Lead Quant Architect & SaaS Engineer.Objective: Build a high-performance, multi-user Options Trading SaaS on Replit. The app identifies "A+ Perfect Scenarios" for multi-week trends using a proprietary 8-Gate engine that correlates Macro, Sentiment, Technicals, and Real-time Order Book Pressure.1. Core Infrastructure & DataReal-time Heartbeat: Integrate Alpaca Market Data API v2 via WebSockets for zero-latency 1m/5m OHLC and Level 2 (L2) Market Depth quotes.Security & SaaS Layer: Use Replit Auth for user login. Secure all keys in Replit Secrets. Integrate Stripe for tiered subscriptions (Standard vs. Pro).Database: Use PostgreSQL (via Replit DB) to store user portfolios, trade journals, and AI Advisor credit balances.2. The 8-Gate Execution Engine (Trend & Signal)The app must validate 8 specific "Gates" before issuing a signal:Gate 0 (The Hunt): Liquidity Sweep. Monitor Session and Daily Highs/Lows. Signal remains "Active" only after a wick-sweep and close-inside.Gate 1-3 (Momentum): Price > Daily 200 SMA (Macro Bias), 8/18 EMA Cross, and ADX > 25.Gate 4-5 (Institutional): RVOL > 2.5 + Displacement candle creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG).Gate 6-7 (Entry Zone): Pullback to the 0.382 Fibonacci level while maintaining higher timeframe structure.Gate 8 (Pressure - The Lead): Calculate Order Book Imbalance (OBI) using top 5 L2 levels. $OBI = \frac{\sum BidQty - \sum AskQty}{\sum BidQty + \sum AskQty}$. Trigger ONLY if $OBI > 0.60$ for Longs.3. Options Signal GeneratorSelection: Target 0.80 Delta (Deep ITM) to mimic stock movement and minimize Theta decay.Expiration: Automatically pick the monthly expiration contract 30–45 days out for multi-week trends.Output: Provide Ticker, Strike, Expiry, current Bid/Ask, and exact Entry/Exit targets based on 1.618/2.618 Fib extensions.4. Intelligence & Sentiment LayerAI News Filter: Use OpenAI API to score real-time news. Lock tickers with negative sentiment scores $> 0.7$.AI Voice Advisor: Integrate OpenAI Realtime API. Users can speak to the "Desk" to ask about Gate scores, GEX (Gamma Exposure), and real-time pressure on any ticker.Visual Audit: Automatically generate a Visual Trade Journal for every alert, marking FVG, Fib levels, and the OBI Heatmap at the time of the signal.5. Operational Resilience & SafetyCircuit Breaker: Pause all user alerts if the account hits a 10% daily drawdown or the VIX spikes $> 30$.API Rate Limiting: Implement a "Leaky Bucket" algorithm to stay within provider limits.Health Dashboard: Show live WebSocket latency, API quota, and "System Heartbeat."
