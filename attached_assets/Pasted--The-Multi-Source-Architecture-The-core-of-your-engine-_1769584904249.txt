🏗️ The Multi-Source Architecture
The core of your engine should be a Python-based FastAPI or Flask server on Replit that acts as the "Brain."

1. The Data Ingestion Layer
TradingView (Webhook): Send JSON alerts when an "Equal High" or "Trendline" is formed.

MT4/5 (ZeroMQ/Named Pipes): Stream real-time tick data to verify if volume supports a sweep.

AI Engine: Feed the last 100 candles into a lightweight model (like a Random Forest or LSTM) to predict the probability of a "Fakeout" vs. "Breakout."

💻 Logic Block: The Multi-Source Rule Engine
This is a conceptual Python structure for your Replit backend to handle multiple sources.

Python
class CentralScanner:
    def __init__(self, symbol):
        self.symbol = symbol
        self.gates = {
            "TV_Liquidity_Detected": False,  # Source: TradingView
            "MT5_Volume_Spike": False,      # Source: MetaTrader 5
            "AI_Fakeout_Prob": 0.0          # Source: Replit AI Logic
        }

    def process_sweep(self, price_data):
        # GATE 1: PRIMARY TRIGGER (Liquidity Sweep)
        # Check if current low < previous swing low AND close > previous swing low
        if price_data['low'] < price_data['swing_low'] and price_data['close'] > price_data['swing_low']:
            
            # GATE 2: SOURCE VALIDATION
            if self.gates["TV_Liquidity_Detected"] and self.gates["MT5_Volume_Spike"]:
                
                # GATE 3: AI CONFIDENCE
                if self.gates["AI_Fakeout_Prob"] > 0.75:
                    return "EXECUTE_LONG_SNIPER"
        
        return "WAITING_FOR_SWEEP"
🛠️ Step-by-Step Improvement Plan
A. Implement "Sweep & Reclaim" Logic
Your scanner should not just look for price touching a level. It must detect a Sweep & Reclaim sequence:

The Trap: Price spikes below a known Swing Low (Retail stops triggered).

The Reclaim: The candle closes back above that Swing Low within 1–3 bars.

The Trigger: This is the only time the scanner "wakes up" for a trade.

B. Add a "Bait" Detection Script (TradingView)
Use a Pine Script on TradingView to identify Equal Highs (EQH) or Equal Lows (EQL). When these form, have the script send a "Pre-Sweep Alert" to your Replit app via Webhook so your scanner can start monitoring that specific pair.

C. AI Sentiment Overlay
Use your AI gate to analyze the speed of the sweep.

Slow Sweep: Often a genuine trend change (High risk).

Fast "V-Shape" Sweep: High-probability institutional hunt (Low risk).
