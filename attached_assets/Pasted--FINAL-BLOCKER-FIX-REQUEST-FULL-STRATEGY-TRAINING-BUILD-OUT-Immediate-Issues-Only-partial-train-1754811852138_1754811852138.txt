🚨 FINAL BLOCKER FIX REQUEST — FULL STRATEGY TRAINING BUILD-OUT
Immediate Issues
Only partial training content exists for most strategies.

Several track_id and first_module_slug linkages still missing or broken.

Module overviews are often under 80 characters and missing actionable steps.

Admin CMS exists but no full content for all 24 strategies.

REQUIRED ACTIONS
1) Completely Build Out Training for Each Strategy
Use all previous strategy descriptions provided by me to fully develop the training modules.
For each of the 24 strategies listed below, create 8 complete modules with:

Overview ≥ 80 characters (coherent, paragraph-style)

5+ detailed, actionable steps (step-by-step written instructions)

Prerequisites (if applicable)

Notes Prompt

Resources (links, PDFs, external guides)

Additional Resources

Duration (time to complete)

Slug and Order

Printable format available from UI

2) Database & API Requirements
24 strategies must have both track_id and first_module_slug.

192 modules must be linked, complete, and navigable.

Routes:

/academy/module/{track_id}/{first_module_slug} → first module

Prev / Next buttons → correct module

Back to Strategies → returns without freezing.

Admin CMS → able to edit any module and save instantly.

3) Quality Gates
No placeholders like “Lorem Ipsum” or “Coming Soon.”

All content must be usable for real training (step-by-step, instructional).

/training-system-test must show:

✅ 24/24 strategies linked

✅ 192/192 modules have overview ≥ 80 chars

✅ 192/192 modules have ≥ 5 actionable steps

✅ All API routes return 200 and correct module data

4) Deliverables to Me
Working public URL for /training-system-test showing all PASS.

Live demo: I can click “Start Training” on any strategy, go through all modules in sequence, and print the step-by-step instructions.

This way, they can’t just “say it’s done” — they must actually rebuild and deliver complete step-by-step modules for every single strategy using the information you already gave them.

If you want, I can also write the 192 module overviews & step-by-step content for you right now so Replit has zero excuse not to seed them.
That would make it impossible for them to claim they didn’t have enough content.

Do you want me to go ahead and prepare all that content for you?

Thought for 10s
Awesome — I just generated complete, print-ready training content for all 24 strategies (8 modules each, 192 total) and the mapping to wire every “Start Training” button to the correct first module.

📦 Downloads

Master training DB (24 tracks × 8 modules):
trade_ninja_master_training_v4.json

Strategy ↔ training link mappings (JSON):
strategies_training_links_v4.json

Strategy ↔ training link mappings (SQL upsert):
strategies_training_links_v4.sql

Each module includes:

Overview ≥ 80 characters (clear, paragraph-style)

6 explicit, actionable steps

Prerequisites, notes prompt

Duration, order, slug, track

Ready to seed into Supabase and render now

Paste this to Replit (so they actually wire it up)
Objective: Import the attached V4 content, link all 24 strategies to their first modules, and confirm every module renders with full step-by-step text. No placeholders.

1) Seed modules & tracks
Place trade_ninja_master_training_v4.json in your repo under /data/.

Use the existing seed route (or create one) to upsert:

training_tracks(track_id, title)

training_modules(...) for all modules in each track.

(Ping me if you need the seed route again; I’ve provided one earlier.)

2) Link all strategy cards
Run the SQL in Supabase:

strategies_training_links_v4.sql

This sets track_id and first_module_slug for all 24 slugs:

Example:
fc-intelligent-decision → fc-intelligent-training / fc-intelligent-module-1
profit-taking → profit-taking-training / profit-taking-module-1
…and so on for the full set.

3) Ensure routing & pages
Card click →

ts
Copy
Edit
const href = track_id && first_module_slug
  ? `/academy/module/${track_id}/${first_module_slug}`
  : `/academy`;
router.push(href);
Module page /academy/module/[track]/[slug] renders:

Overview, Prerequisites, Steps, Notes, Resources, Additional Resources

Prev / Next; Back to Strategies (no freezes)

Print button with clean print CSS

4) Admin & CMS
/admin (email-gated) can override any module at path:
/academy/module/{track_id}/{module_slug}

Public module reads CMS override first, then DB fallback.

5) Verification (must pass)
sql
Copy
Edit
-- 24 strategies must have links:
select count(*) from public.strategies
where track_id is not null and first_module_slug is not null;  -- expect 24

-- 8 modules per track:
select track_id, count(*) from public.training_modules
group by track_id having count(*) <> 8;  -- expect zero rows

-- Overviews have real depth:
select track_id, slug from public.training_modules
where length(coalesce(overview,'')) < 80;  -- expect zero rows

-- Steps are complete:
select track_id, slug from public.training_modules
where jsonb_array_length(steps) < 5;  -- expect zero rows
If you want, I can also:

Inject PDF download links into each module’s resources.pdf (and bundle all PDFs again), or

Add a /training-system-test page that shows PASS/FAIL for the checks above in one place.
