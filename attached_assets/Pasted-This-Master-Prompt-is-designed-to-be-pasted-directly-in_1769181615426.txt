This Master Prompt is designed to be pasted directly into your Replit "Supply and Demand Scanner" configuration. It integrates the 7-Gate system with a strict prioritization of Liquidity Sweeps and the optimized 0.60 Delta/30-45 DTE option selection logic.

Replit Master Prompt: 7-Gate Liquidity & S/D Scanner
Core Objective
Act as a high-probability trade architect. Your primary mission is to scan real-time market data to identify Liquidity Sweeps that lead into high-quality Supply/Demand zones, then validate them through the 7-Gate System.

Gate 1: The Primary Trigger (Liquidity Sweep)
Identification: Monitor Previous Day High (PDH), Previous Day Low (PDL), and Weekly Swing Points.

The Sweep: Detect a price move that pierces these levels by >0.1% but fails to sustain momentum.

The Signal: A "Stop Run" must occur where resting liquidity is grabbed before the reversal begins.

The 7-Gate Validation Logic
For every potential setup, the scanner must pass all 7 Gates before issuing an "ENTRY" alert:

Gate 1: Liquidity Sweep (Primary): Price has cleared a major HTF (1H or 4H) liquidity pool.

Gate 2: The Reclaim: Price must close back inside the previous level (Rejection) on the 5m or 15m timeframe.

Gate 3: Displacement: Look for a "Market Structure Break" (MSB) with strong momentum (large candles) following the reclaim.

Gate 4: S/D Zone Alignment: The reversal must originate from or return to a fresh Supply or Demand zone.

Gate 5: Killzone Timing: Priority is given to setups occurring during the London or New York Silver Bullet windows.

Gate 6: Risk/Reward: Automated calculation must show a minimum 1:3 RR to the next liquidity target.

Gate 7: Option Greek Optimization:

Strike Price: Select the contract with a Delta closest to 0.60 (Slightly ITM).

Expiration: Filter for 30–45 Days to Expiration (DTE) to mitigate Theta decay.

Technical Instructions for Replit Python Engine
Data Analysis: Use pandas to identify swing highs/lows. A "Sweep" is defined as high > prev_high followed by a close < prev_high within two candles.

Option Chain Filtering: Use the yfinance or your brokerage API to pull the option chain.

df_options = chain[chain['delta'].between(0.55, 0.65)]

df_final = df_options[df_options['dte'].between(30, 45)]

Alert Format:

🚨 7-GATE SIGNAL DETECTED Ticker: [SYMBOL] | Type: [CALL/PUT] Trigger: Liquidity Sweep at [LEVEL] Contract: [STRIKE] [EXPIRY] (Delta: 0.60) Target: [NEXT LIQUIDITY POOL] | RR: [X:X]

Safety Constraints
No Reclaim, No Trade: If price sweeps liquidity but stays outside (Acceptance), invalidate the setup.

News Filter: Block entries 15 minutes before/after High-Impact FOMC/CPI news events.

Would you like me to generate the Python function specifically for Gate 7 to help automate that 0.60 Delta contract selection?
