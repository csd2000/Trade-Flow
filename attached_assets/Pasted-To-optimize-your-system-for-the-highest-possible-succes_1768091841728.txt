To optimize your system for the highest possible success rate, I have updated the HFC Master Prompt below.

This version elevates the "Liquidity Sweep" from a simple filter to the Primary Execution Trigger. This means the bot will now actively hunt for "Stop Hunts" (institutional manipulation) before checking the 7-Gate confluence, ensuring you enter only when the most powerful market move is about to occur.

🚀 HFC v8.0: The "Liquidity Hunter" Master Prompt
Copy and paste this into the Replit Agent:

Role: Senior Quant Developer & SMC Specialist.

Objective: Build an HFC (High-Frequency Confluence) Scanner that prioritizes Liquidity Sweeps followed by an ICC (Indication-Correction-Continuation) entry model.

1. Primary Trigger (The Hunt):

Gate 0 (The Sweep): Monitor the Previous Day High/Low and Session High/Low. The system triggers a "Ready" state only when a candle wicks beyond these levels but closes back inside (Liquidity Sweep).

2. The 7-Gate Validation Engine: Once a Sweep is detected, validate with the following:

Gate 1 (Floor): Price > 50 EMA.

Gate 4 (Volume): RVOL > 2.5 (High conviction).

Gate 5 (ICC Indication): Displacement candle body > 80% with an associated Fair Value Gap (FVG).

Gate 6 (Opening Range): Price must be above/below the 15m Opening Range (9:30-9:45 AM).

Gate 7 (Fibonacci): Price must perform a "Weak Pullback" to the 0.382 level without touching the 0.50 level.

3. Options & Execution:

Contract: Select the 0.80 Delta Call/Put expiring in 25-35 days.

Entry: Market order when the 1m candle rejects the 0.382 Fibonacci level.

Stop Loss: Hard stop at the 0.50 Fibonacci level or the bottom of the "Sweep" candle.

Take Profit: 1.618 Fib Extension or the "Wick Fill" of the opposing side.

4. Mismatch Logic (The Kill-Switch):

Immediately alert "EXIT" if: (1) 1m candle color mismatches the bias, (2) MACD Histogram decreases, or (3) Price closes inside the FVG.

5. Assets & UI:

Assets: [BITF, NIO, CLYM, BBAI, SOUN, IPSC].

Dashboard: Live "Sweep Tracker" showing which stocks have just hunted liquidity.

Why this is your "A+" Scenario
The Sweep removes the retail competition.

The Displacement proves the "Big Boys" are in.

The 0.382 Fib ensures you aren't chasing the move.

The 0.80 Delta ensures you get paid like you're holding the stock, but with the leverage of options.
