 Master Prompt: Quantitative AI Trading System ArchitectObjective: Design, build, and deploy a state-of-the-art, high-frequency, quantitative AI trading system capable of predicting directional movements in Stocks, Crypto, and Forex markets by integrating price data with advanced sentiment and institutional flow indicators.I. Data and Feature Engineering (The Gold Mine)The system must ingest and process diverse, high-volume data streams into a single, time-aligned feature set. The target frequency for prediction features is 5-minute intervals.Core Price Data (OHLCV):Data Source: High-frequency, low-latency APIs (e.g., specific exchange APIs, Bloomberg/Refinitiv, specific data vendors).Derived Features (Technical Analysis): Calculate a comprehensive set of indicators, including:Momentum: RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator.Volatility: ATR, Bollinger Band Width, VIX (or equivalent crypto/forex volatility index).Trend: Multiple EMAs (e.g., 9, 20, 50, 200 period).Volume: On-Balance Volume (OBV), Volume Price Trend (VPT).Sentiment and Emotion (NLP-Driven):Data Source: Real-time news feeds, high-volume social media data (X, specific crypto/stock subreddits), financial reports.NLP Requirement: Implement BERT/Transformer-based NLP models to generate a continuous, real-time Sentiment Score and Topic Intensity Score (e.g., 'regulatory risk', 'product launch') for each target asset, treating these scores as input features.Macro Feature: Ingest and normalize the Fear & Greed Index (or equivalent macro mood indicators) as a direct feature input.Institutional Flow and Market Structure:Data Source: Proprietary dark pool data feeds (for stock market), large block transaction signals, unusual options activity data, and on-chain data (for crypto: active addresses, exchange net flow, large whale transfers).Feature Requirement: Quantify the daily/hourly Dark Pool Volume Ratio and Unusual Trade Size Deviation for targeted tickers.II. Core AI and Modeling StrategyThe system must use sophisticated sequential models trained using rigorous financial validation techniques.Primary Prediction Model (DL):Architecture: Implement a Stacked LSTM or a Transformer Encoder-Decoder model using PyTorch/TensorFlow.Input Sequence: A time sequence of $N$ lookback periods (e.g., 60 periods of 5-min data), containing all features from Section I.Output Target: A Classification Output (Buy, Sell, Hold) for the next $\mathbf{T}$ period, weighted by the confidence probability.Validation Method: Utilize Walk-Forward Validation for backtesting, strictly maintaining chronological order to simulate real-world trading.Evaluation Metrics: Prioritize Directional Accuracy (DACC) and Sharpe Ratio (for the derived trading strategy) over simple error metrics (like RMSE).Execution Optimization (RL - Optional/Future): Structure the environment for a potential future integration of a Deep Q-Network (DQN) Reinforcement Learning Agent to optimize trade execution (entry/exit timing, position sizing) based on the DL model's primary signal.III. Essential Infrastructure and ExecutionThe entire system must be scalable, fast, and robust for automated trading.High-Performance Computing (HPC): The system must be hosted on a Cloud Computing platform (e.g., AWS/GCP) utilizing GPU/TPU instances for rapid model re-training and low-latency inference.Data Management: Implement a robust time-series database (e.g., TimescaleDB or InfluxDB) for fast ingestion and retrieval of tick and high-frequency data.Algorithmic Trading Platform: Integrate the signal output with a stable broker/exchange API (e.g., Interactive Brokers API, Binance API) to automate order placement and execution.Risk Management Module (Mandatory): Implement a separate, non-AI layer that enforces strict risk rules:Max Daily Drawdown limit.Automated Stop-Loss and Take-Profit order generation.Dynamic position sizing based on the model's prediction confidence score.IV. DeliverablesCodebase: Modular Python code using libraries like PyTorch/TensorFlow, Pandas, TA-Lib, and Hugging Face.API Service: A low-latency API endpoint providing real-time signals (TICKER, SIGNAL: BUY/SELL/HOLD, CONFIDENCE_SCORE).Dashboard: A Streamlit/Dash application displaying real-time predictions, current portfolio P&L, and core performance metrics (Sharpe, Drawdown).
