financial markets are primarily driven by Federal Reserve policy shifts, persistent inflation concerns, and the fallout from major geopolitical and domestic policy shocks (such as tariffs and government shutdowns). 
1. Most Impactful Data (Common Factors)
Federal Reserve Decisions: The Fed's shift to an easing cycle is the dominant force. A quarter-point rate cut on December 10, 2025, brought the benchmark rate to 3.50%–3.75%. Markets are highly sensitive to whether these are "insurance cuts" or the start of a deep cycle.
Inflation (CPI/PCE): Inflation remains sticky in the upper-2% area, preventing more aggressive rate cuts. In 2025, Bitcoin has shown a high 0.8 correlation with inflation data, functioning increasingly as a macroeconomic risk asset.
Employment Data (NFP): While hiring has moderated, the Fed is closely watching for "labor market softness" to justify further cuts in early 2026. 
2. Market-Specific Drivers
Forex:
Geopolitics & Trade: The "Liberation Day" tariff announcements and potential devaluation of the Chinese yuan due to U.S. import tariffs are major volatility drivers.
Domestic Policies: The longest government shutdown in U.S. history in late 2025 created massive data gaps, forcing traders to rely on alternative sentiment indicators.
Stock Market:
AI Infrastructure Spending: Capital outlays for AI remain a primary engine for GDP; however, extreme valuations in the "Magnificent Seven" have made the S&P 500 vulnerable to any earnings misses in this sector.
Regulatory Legislation: The passage of the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act has significantly impacted crypto-related stocks.
Cryptocurrency:
Institutional Adoption: The rise of Spot ETFs and the U.S. government’s formalization of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (holding over 200,000 BTC) have deeply linked crypto prices to traditional financial cycles.
Liquidity Vacuums: Despite early 2025 highs, a massive end-of-year "liquidity vacuum" saw over $1.2 trillion in market value erased in late 2025 as leverage was wiped out. 
3. Current Market Sentiment (December 2025)
Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Currently stands at 24 ("Extreme Fear"), reflecting eroded confidence following sharp year-end retreats.
Asset Correlation: Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 has risen to 0.5 (up from 0.29 in 2024), meaning it now moves much more in sync with traditional risk-on/risk-off cycles.
